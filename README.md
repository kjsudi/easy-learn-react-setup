# easy-learn-react-setup
This repository teaches one how to get started with react. From the grassroots.

What you will need:
A computer with a terminal

How to do it:
If you are using a mac, you can open the terminal and first install Node.

Node is used to run Javascript on your computer. Javascript, used to run only inyour browser, but now with node, you can run it just like any program.


Install by typing 'brew install node'

This automatically npm too. Npm is node package manager. Its like the maven of Java. It helps you with imports and dependency organization.

Check if you have npm installed by typing 'npm -v'

If you get an output, proceed. Else, first intsall npm.

If you have npm > 5.2, you already have npx installed too. So, proceed.


Type in  'npx create-react-app react-setup'

The above command will take sometime for it to complete. That's it. You have already created your first basic react application.

That's it for now. Proceed to next repostitory for more lessons.

Happy Reacting :D
